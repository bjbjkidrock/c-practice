/*
 * Write a program that declares three one-dimensional arrays named price,
 * quantity, and amount. Each array should be delcared in main() and should
 * be capableof holding 10 double-percision numbers. The numbers that should
 * be stored in price are:
 *
 * 	- 10.62, 14.89, 16.55, 18.62, 9.47, 6.58, 18.32, 12.15, 3.98
 *
 * The numbers that should be stored in quantity are:
 *
 * 	- 4, 8.5, 6, 8.35, 9, 15.3, 3, 5.4, 2.9, 4.8
 *
 * Your program should pass these three arrays to a function called extend(),
 * which should calculate the elements in the amount array as the product
 * of the equivalent elements in the price and quantity arrays (for example, 
 * amount[1] = price[1] * quantity[1]). After extend() has put values into the
 * amount array, the values in the array should be displayed from within main.
