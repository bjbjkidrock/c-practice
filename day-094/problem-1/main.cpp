/*
 * Exercise 6:
 * A company currently maintains two lists of part numbers, where each
 * part number is an integer. Write a C program that compares these lists
 * of numbers and displays the numbers, if any, that are common to both.
 * (Hint: sort each list prior to making the comparison).
 *
 * Redo exercise 6, but display a list of part numebers that are only
 * on one list, but not both.
