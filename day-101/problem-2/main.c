/*
 * Incldue the string library functions strlen(), strcat(), and strncat() within a
 * function having the prototype int concat(char string[], char string2[], int maxlength).
 * The concat() function should perform a complete concatenation of string2 to string1
 * only if the length of the concatenated string does not exceed maxlength, which is the
 * maximum length defined for string1. If the concatenated string exceeds maxlength, 
 * conctenate only the characters in string2, so that the maximum combined string length
 * is equal to maxlength - 1, which provides enough room for the end-of-string NULL
 * character.
