/*
 * Write, compile, and execute a C program that creates a binary file named
 * points and writes the following numbers to the file:
 *
 * 	6.3    8.2    18.25    24.32
 *	4.0    4.0    10.0     -5.0
 *     -2.0    5.0     4.0      5.0
 *
 * Using the data in the points file created - write, compile, and run a C
 * program that reads four numbers using a for loop and interprets the first
 * and second numbers in each record as the coordinates of one point and the
 * third and fourth numbers as the coordinates of a second point. Have the
 * program compute and display the slope and midpoint of each pair of entered
 * points.
