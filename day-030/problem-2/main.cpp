/*
 * In the game of blackjack, the cards 2 through 10 are counted at their face value,
 * regardless of suit, all face cards (jack, queen, and king) are counted as 10, and an
 * ace is counted as either a 1 or an 11, depending on the total count of all the cards
 * in a player's hand. The ace is counted as 11 only if the resulting total value of all
 * cards in a player's hand does not exceed 21, else it is counted as a 1. Using this 
 * information, write a C program that accepts three card values as inputs (a 1 corresponding
 * to an ace, a 2 corresponding to a two, and so on), calculate the total value of the hand
 * appropriately, and displays the value of the three cards with a printed message.
