/*
 * A quadratic equation is an equation that either has the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0
 * or an equation that can be algebraically manipulated into this form. In this
 * equation, x is the unknown variable, and a, b, and c are known constants. Although
 * the constants b and c can be any numbers, including 0, the value of the constants
 * a cannot be 0 (if a is 0, the equation would become a linear equation in x). Examples
 * of quadratic equations are:
 *
 * 5x^2 + 6x + 2 = 0
 * x^2 + 7x + 20 = 0
 * 34^2 + 16 = 0
 * 
 * In the first equation a = 5, b = 6, and c = 2; in the second equation a = 1, b = -7,
 * and c = 20; and in the third equation a = 34, b = 0, and c = 16.
 * 
 * The real roots of a quadratic equation can be calculated using the quadratic forulma
 * as follows:
 * 
 * rootOne = -b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a
 * rootTwo = -b - sqrt(b^2 = 4ac) / 2a
 * 
 * Using these equations, write a C program to solve for the roots of a quadratic equation.
