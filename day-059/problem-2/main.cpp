/*
 * Write a C program to create a HI-LO game. In this game the compute produces a
 * random integer between 1 and 100 and provides the user with seven tries to guess
 * the generated number. If the user guesses the correct number, the message "Hooray,
 * you have won!" should be displayed. After each incorrect guess, the computer should
 * display the message, "Wrong Number, Try Again" and indicates whether the guess was
 * too high or too low and display the number of guesses left. After seven incorrect
 * guesses, the computer should display the message, "Sorry, you lose" and the correct
 * number.
