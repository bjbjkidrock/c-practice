 * The selection and bubble sort both use the same technique for swapping

 * swap by a call to a funcito named swap. The prototype for swap should be
 * void swap(int *, int *). The swap() function should be constructed using
 * the algorithm presented in section 7.4
 *
 * describe why the function quicksort() does not require the swap algorithm
 * used by the selection and bubble sorts.
