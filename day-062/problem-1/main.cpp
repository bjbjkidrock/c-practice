/*
 * In the game of blackjack, the cards 2 through 10 are counted at their face values, regardless
 * of suit, all picture cards (jack, queen, and king) are counted as 10, and an ace is
 * counted as either a 1 or an 11, depending on the total count of all the cards in a player's
 * hand. The ace is counted as 11 only if the total value of all cards in a player's hand does
 * not exceed 21, else it is counted as a 1. Using this information write a C program that uses
 * a random number generator to select three cards (a 1 initially corresponding to an ace,
 * a 2 corresponding to a face card of two, and so on), calculate the total value of the 
 * hand appropriately, and display the value of the three cards with a printed message.c:w
