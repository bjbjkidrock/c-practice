/*
 * Create file named employee.dat containing the following data:
 *
 * 	+---------+------+-------+-------+----------+
 * 	| Anthony | A.J. | 10031 |  7.82 | 12/18/62 |
 * 	+---------+------+-------+-------+----------+
 * 	| Burrows | W.K. | 10067 |  9.14 |  6/9/63  |
 * 	+---------+------+-------+-------+----------+
 * 	|   Fain  | B.D. | 10083 |  8.74 |  5/18/59 |
 * 	+---------+------+-------+-------+----------+
 * 	|  Janney |  P.  | 10095 | 10.57 |  9/28/62 |
 * 	+---------+------+-------+-------+----------+
 * 	|  Smith  | G.J. | 10105 |  8.50 | 12/20/61 |
 * 	+---------+------+-------+-------+----------+ 
 *
 * Write a program called fcopy to read the employee.dat and produce a duplicate copy of the
 * file named employee.dat.bak
 *
 * Modify the program to accept the name of the original and duplicate file as user input.
 *
 * Since fcopy always copies data from an original file to a duplicate file, can you think
 * of a better method of accepting the original and duplicate filenames than prompting the
 * user for them each time the program is executed?
