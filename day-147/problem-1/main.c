/*
 * Write a C function named diffDays() that calculates and returns the difference between two days.
 * Each date is passed to the function as a struct using the following global structure:
 *
 *  struct Date
 *  {
 *      int month;
 *      int day;
 *      int year;
 *  };
 *
 *  The diffDays() function should make two calls to the days() function written for the previous
 *  day's exercise.
