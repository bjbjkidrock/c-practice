/*
 * Write a C function named toUpper() that converts individual lowcase letters into
 * uppercas letters. The expression ch - 'a' + 'A' can be used to make the conversion
 * for any lowercase character stored in ch.
 *
 * Add a data input check to the function written above to verify that a valid lowercase
 * letter is passed to the function. A character is lowercase if it is greater than or equal
 * to a and less than or equal to z. If the character is not a valid lowercase letter, have
 * the function toUperr() return the passed character unaltered.
 *
 * Write a C program that accepts a string from a terminal and converts all lowercase letters
 * in the string to uppercase leters.
