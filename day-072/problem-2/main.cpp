/*
 * The following algorithm, discovered by Euclid, provides a simple means
 * of determining the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b
 * (the GCD is the largest number that divides evenly into both numbers with no remainder):
 * 	a) divide the larger number by the smaller and retain the remainder
 * 	b) divide the smaller number by the remainder, again retaining the remainder
 * 	c) continue dividing the prior remainder by the current remainder until the 
 * 	   remainder is 0, at which point the last non-0 remainder is the GCD.
 *
 * Write a recursive function named gcd() that implements this algorithm.
