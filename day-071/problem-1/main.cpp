/*
 * The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ...
 * where the first two terms are 0 and 1, and each term
 * thereafter is defined recursively as the sum of two
 * preceding terms; that is
 *
 * Fib(n) = n for n < 2
 * Fib(n) = Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2) for n >= 2
 *
 * Write a recursive function that returns the nth number in
 * the Fibonacci sequence when n is passed to the function as
 * an argument. For example, when n = 8, the function returns
 * the 8th number in the sequence, which is 13.
