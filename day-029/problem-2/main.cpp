/*
 * All years that are evenly divisible by 400 or are evenly divisible by 4
 * and not evenly divisible by 100 are leap years. For example, since 1600
 * is evenly divisible by 400, the year 1600 was a leap year. Similary, since
 * 1988 is evenly divisible by 4 but not by 100, the year 1988 was also a leap
 * year. Using this information, write a C program that accepts the year as user
 * input, determine if the year is a leap year, and display an appropriate message
 * that tells the user if the entered year is or is not a leap year. 
 *
 * Use this logic to re-write the program from yesterday (day-028)!
