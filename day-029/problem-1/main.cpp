/*
 * The quadrant in which a line drawn from the origin resides is determined by the
 * angle that the line makes with the posititve X axis as follows:
 *
 * | Angle from the Positive X | Quadrant |
 * |---------------------------|----------|
 * | Between 0 - 90 degrees    | I	  |
 * | Between 90 - 180 degrees  | II	  | 
 * | Between 180 - 270 degrees | III	  |
 * | Between 270 - 360 degrees | IV	  |
 * 
 * Using this information, write a C program that accepts the angle of the line as user
 * input and determines and displays the quadrant appropriate to the input data. (Note:
 * If the angle is exactly 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees, the corresponding lines does not
 * reside in any quadrant but lies on any axis.
 * 
 * Create a message that identifies an angle of 0 degrees as the positive X-axis, and 
 * angle of 90 degrees as the positive Y-Axis, an angle of 180 degrees as the negative
 * X-axis, and an angle of 270 degrees as the negative Y-axis.
