 * It has been said that a monkey pushing keys at random on a keyboard, could produce the

 * display letters at random. Count the number of letters typed until the program produces
 * one of the two-letter words:
 * 	- at, is, he, we, up, or on
 *
 * when one of these words is produced, stop the program and display the total number of 
 * letters typed. (Hint: Choose a letter by selecting a random integer number between 1 
 * and 26)
