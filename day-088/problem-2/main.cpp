/*
 * Write a C function that adds respective values of two double
 * dimensional arrays named first and second. Both arrays have
 * 2 rows and 3 columns. For example, element [1][2] of the result
 * array should be the sum of first[1][2] and second[1][2]. Assume
 * the arrays are arrays of integers. The first and second arrays
 * should be initialized as follows:
 *
 * 	First		Second
 * 	16 18 23	24 52 77
 * 	54 91 11	16 19 59
