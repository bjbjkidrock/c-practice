/*
 * A bookstore summarizes its monthly transactions by keeping the following information
 * for each book in stock:
 * - Book indentification number
 * - Inventory balance at the beginning of the month
 * - Number of copies received during the month
 * - Number of coopies sold during the month
 * 
 * Write a C program that accepts this data for each book and then displays the book
 * identification number and an update book inventory balance using the relationship:
 *	+ number of copies received during the month
 * 	- number of copies sold during the month
 *
 * This program should use a while statement with a fixed-count condition, so that 
 * information on only three books is requested.
