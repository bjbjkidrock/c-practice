/*
 * Write a C program that reads a list of double-precision grades
 * from the keyboard into an array named grades. The grades are
 * to be counted as they are read, and entry is to be terminated
 * when a negative value has been entered. Once all of the grades
 * have been input, your program should find and display the sum
 * and average of the grades. The grades should then be listed
 * with an asterisk (*) in front of each grade that is below
 * average.
 *
 * Extend the program written above, to display each grade
 * and its letter equivalent. Assume the following scale:
 * 	- A: greater or equal to 90
 * 	- B: greater or equal to 80 and less than 90
 * 	- C: greater or equal to 70 and less than 80
 * 	- D: greater or equal to 60 and less than 70
 * 	- F: anything below or equal to 59
