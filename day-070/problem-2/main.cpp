/*
 * The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ... where the first two terms
 * are 0 and 1, and each term thereafter is defined recursively at the sum of the
 * two preceding terms; that is
 *
 * 	Fib(n) = n 	for n < 2
 * 	Fib(n) = Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n -2) for n >= 2
 *
 * Write a recursive function that returns the nth number in a Fibonacci sequence when n
 * is passed to the function as an argument. For example, when n = 8, the function returns
 * the 8th number in the sequence, which is 13.
 *
 * Alternatively write a function that uses repetition to calculate the nth term of a Fibonacci
 * sequence.
