/*
 * Write a C program that accepts a number followed by one space and then a letter.
 * If the letter following the number is f, the program is to treat the number as a
 * temperature in degrees Fahrenheiet, convert the number to the equivalent degrees
 * Celsius, and print a suitable display message. If the letter following the number
 * is c, the program is to treat the number entered as a temperature in Celsius,
 * convert the number to the equivalente degrees Fahrenheit, and print a suitable
 * display message. If the letter is neither f nor c, the program should print a
 * message indicating that the data entered is incorrect and terminate. Use and if-
 * else chain in your program and make use of the conversion formulas:
 * Celsius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (Fahrenheit - 32.0)
 * Fahrenheit = (9.0 / 5.0) * Celsius + 32.0
