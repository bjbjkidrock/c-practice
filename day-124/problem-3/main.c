 * Pollen count readings, which are taken from August through September in the 
 * northeastern region of the United States, measure the number of ragweed pollen
 * grains in the air. Pollen countds in the range of 10 to 200 grains per cubic
 * meter of air are typical during this time of year. Pollen counts above 10 begin
 * to affect a small percentage of hay fever sufferers, counts in the range of 30
 * to 40 will noticeably bother approximately 30 percent of hay fever suffers,
 * and counts between 40 and 50 adversely affect more than 60 percent of all
 * hay fever sufferers.
