/*
 * Create a function named setHolidays() that reads and displays the currnet list
 * of holidays and then lets the user change, add, or delete holidayts from the 
 * list. After a holiday has been modified, the function should sort the holidays and
 * display the new list. Finally the function should ask the user whether the new
 * list should be saved; if the user responds affirmatively, the function should write
 * the new data to the existing Holidays.txt file, overwriting the contents of the existing
 * file.
