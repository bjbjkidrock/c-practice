/*
 * Write a program that inputs 10 double-percision numbers into an array named raw.
 * After 10 user-input numbers are entered into the array, your program should cycle
 * through raw 10 times. During each pass through the array, your program should
 * select the lowest value in raw and place the selected value in the next available
 * solt in an array named sorted. Thus, when your program is complete, the sorted
 * array should contain the numbers in raw in sorted order from lowest to highest.
 * (Hint: make sure to reset the lowest value selected during each pass to a very high
 * number so that it is not selected again. You will need a second for loop within
 * the first for loop to locate the minimum value for each pass.)
 *
 * The method used for sorting in this program is inefficient. Can you determine
 * why? What might be a better method of sorting the numbers in an array?
