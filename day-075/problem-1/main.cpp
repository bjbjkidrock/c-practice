/*
 * Write a C program that declares three one-dimensional arrays named price,
 * quantity, and amount. Each array should be capable of holding 10 elements.
 * Using a for loop, input values for the price and quantity arrays. The
 * entries in the amount array should be the product of the corresponding
 * values in the price and quantity arrays (thus, amount[i] = quantity[i] * price[i];).
 * After all of the data has been entered display the following output:
 *
 * 	Quantity Price Amount
 * 	-------- ----- ------
