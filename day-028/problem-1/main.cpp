/*
 * Write a program that displays the following two prompts:
 * "Enter a month (use 1 for Jan, etc):"
 * "Enter a day of the month:"
 * 
 * Your program should accept and store a number in a variable
 * in response to the first prompt, and accept and store a number
 * in a variable named day in response to the second prompt. If
 * the month entered is not between 1 and 12 inclusive, the program
 * should print a message informing the user that an invalid month
 * has been entered. If the day entered is not between 1 and 31 inclusive,
 * the program should print a message informing the user that an invalid
 * day has been entered.
 *
 * What will your program do if the user types a number with a decimal point
 * for the month? How can you ensure that your if statements check for an
 * integer number?
 *
 * In a non-leap year, February has 28 days; the months January, March, May
 * July, August, October, and December has 31 days; and all the other months
 * have 30 days. Using this information, the program needs to display a message
 * when an invalid day is entered for a user-entered month - for this program
 * ignore leap years.
