/*
 * Write a C program that keeps track of the frequency of occurance of
 * each vowel as lines of text are typed at the keyboard. The end of
 * the text should be signified by entry of an EOF (end of file) marker
 * (ctrl z for DOS and ctrl d for Unix). The output of your program
 * should be a count of each vowel encountered in the input text.
 *
 * Add a function to the program written that displays a histogram of
 * the number of each vowel encountered. For example, if your program
 * detected the letter a five times, the letter e three times, the 
 * letter i two times, the letter o four times, and the letter u 1
 * time, the histogram should appear as:
 *
 * 	a |***** 
 * 	e |*** 
 * 	i |** 
 *	o |*** 
 *	u |*
 *	  +----|----|-----|
 *	  0    5    10    15
