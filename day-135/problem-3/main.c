/*
 * Write a program that stores the string "Hooray for All of Us" in an array

 * ensures that the end-of-string escape sequence \0 is included in the array. Display
 * the characters in the array by changing the address in a pointer called messPtr.
 * Use a for statement in you program.
 *
 * Modify the program written to use the while statement while (*messPtr != '\0').
 *
 * Modify the program written to start the display with the word All.
