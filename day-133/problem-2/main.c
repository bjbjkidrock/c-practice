/*
 * Write a C program that has a declaration in main() to store the following 
 * numbers into an array named rates: 6.5, 7.2, 7.5, 9.3, 9.6, 9.4, 9.6, 9.8, 10.0.
 * There should be a function call to show() that accepts rates in a parameter named
 * rates and then displays the numbers using the pointer notation * (rates + i).
 *
 * Modify the show() function written to alter the address in rates. Use the expression
 * *rates rather than *(rates + i) to retrieve the correct element.
