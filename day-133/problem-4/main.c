/*
 * Write a C program that delcares three single-dimensional arrays named
 * price, quantity, and amount. Each array should be declared in main() and
 * be capable of holding 10 double-percision numbers. The numbers to be stored in
 * price are 10.62, 14.89, 13.21, 16.55, 19.62, 9.47, 6.58, 19.32, 12.15, 3.99.
 * The numbers to be stored in quantity are 4, 9.5, 6, 7.35, 9, 15.3, 3, 5.4, 2.9,
 * 4.9. Have your program pass these arrays to a function called extend(), which
 * calculates the elements in the amount array as the product of the equivalent
 * elements in the price and quantity arrays (for example, amount[1] = price[1] *
 * quantity[1]). After extend() has put values into the amount array, display the
 * values in the array from within main(). Write the extend() function using 
 * pointers.
