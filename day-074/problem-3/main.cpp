/*
 * Write a C program to input the following integer numbers into an array named
 * grades:
 * 	89, 95, 72, 83, 99, 54, 86, 75, 92, 73, 79, 75, 82, 73
 *
 * As each number is input, add the numbers to the total. After all numbers are
 * input and the total is obtained, calculate the average of the numbers and use
 * the average to determine the deviation of each value from the average. Store
 * each deviation in an array named deviation. Each deviation is obtained
 * as the element value less the average of all the data. Have the program
 * display each diviation alongside its corresponding element from the grades
 * array.
 *
 * Calculate the variance of data - the variance is obtained by squaring each
 * individual deviation and dividing the sum of the squared deviations by 
 * the number of deviations.
