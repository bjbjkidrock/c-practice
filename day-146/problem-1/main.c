/*
 * Write a C function named days() that determines the number of days from the date
 * 1/1/1900 for any date passed as a structure. Use the following Date structure:
 *
 * struct Date
 * {
 *      int month;
 *      int day;
 *      int year;
 * };
 *
 * In writing the days() function, use the convention that all years have 360 days and
 * each month consist of 30 days. The function should return the number of days for any
 * date structure passed to it.
