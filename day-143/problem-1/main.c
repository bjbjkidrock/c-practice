/*
 * Declare a single structure type suitable for an employee record consisting of an integer
 * indentification number, a last name (consisting of a maximum of 20 characters), a floating-point
 * pay rate, and a floating-point number of hours worked.
 *
 * Using the stucture type declared in the above, write a C program that interactively accepts the following
 * data into an array of six structures:
 *
 * id number        name            pay rate        hours worked
 * --------         ----            -------         ------------
 * 3462             Jones           4.62            40.0
 * 6793             Robbins         5.83            38.5
 * 6985             Smith           5.22            45.5
 * 7834             Swain           6.89            40.0
 * 8867             Timmins         6.43            35.5
 * 9002             Williams        4.75            42.0
 *
 * Once the data has been entered, the program should create a payroll report listing each employee's name,
 * number, and gross pay. Inlcude the total gross pay of all employees at the end of the report.
