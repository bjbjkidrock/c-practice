/*
 * Write a C function named delChar() that can be used to delete characters from a string.
 * The function should accept three arguments: the string name, the number of characters to
 * delete delete, and the starting position in the string where characters should be deleted.
 * For example, the function call delChar(string, 13, 5), when applied to the string
 * "all enthusiastic people", should result in the string "all people".
