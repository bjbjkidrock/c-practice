/*
 * Write a C program that stores the following prices in a global
 * array:
 * 	- 9.92, 6.32, 12.63, 5.95, 10.29
 *
 * Your program should also create two automatic arrays named units
 * and amounts, each capable of storing five double-percision numbers.
 * Using a for loop and a scanf() function call, have the program
 * accept five user-input numbers into the units array when the program
 * is run. The program should store the product of the corresponding values
 * in the prices and units array in the amounts array (for example,
 * amountsn[i] = price[i] * units[i]) and display the following output:
 *
 * Price	Units		Amount
 * -----	----		------
 * 9.92		  *		   *
 * ...		....		......
 *
 * Total: 			......
