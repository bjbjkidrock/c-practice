/*
 * The following data was collected on a recent automobile trip:
 *
 * Mileage		| Gallons
 * 22495, start	  	  12.2
 * 22841		  11.3 
 * 23185		  10.5
 * 23400		  11.0
 * 23772		  12.2
 * 24055		  14.7
 * 24434		  14.3
 * 24804		  15.2
 *
 * Write a C program that accept a mileage and gallons value to calculate the mile-per-gallon (mpg)
 * achieved for that segment of the trip. THe mpg is obtained as the difference in mileage between
 * fill-ups divided by the number of gallons of gasoline received in the fill-up. 
 *
 * Next, compute and display the cummulative mpg achieved after each fill-up. The cummulative mpg
 * is calculated as the difference between each fill-up mileage and the mileage at the start of the
 * trip divided by the sum of the gallons used to that point in the trip.
